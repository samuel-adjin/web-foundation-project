                <p>FaraBank Ghana Limited is the oldest commercial bank in Ghana and has been
                     listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange since 1991. It began its operations in 1896 as the Bank

                      era until 1953. The Bank has three client segments – Corporate and Institutional Banking,
                       Retail Banking and Commercial Banking supported by five product groups – Transaction Banking,
